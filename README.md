# Death-First-Search---Episode-1
One solution of the Codingame puzzle "Death First Search - Episode 1"

I created two version of the algorithm.
One that delete the closest link to the gates, using a more defensive approach.
The other version is a bit the same, but it tries to delete the closest links to the "Bobnet agent" (the attacker).
Both solution works well for the first level of the puzzle, and to some extent for the second level of the challenge: "Death First Search - Episode 2".
