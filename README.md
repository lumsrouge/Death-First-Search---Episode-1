# Death-First-Search---Episode-1
One solution of the Codingame puzzle "Death First Search - Episode 1"

I created two version of the algorithm.
One that delete the closest link to the gates, using a more defensive approach.

The other version is a bit the same, but it tries to delete the closest links to the "Bobnet agent" (the attacker).
